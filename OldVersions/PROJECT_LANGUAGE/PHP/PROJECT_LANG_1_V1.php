// I decided to make PHP the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive/Images/ProtonDMail) as PHP has the ProtonMail color (purple) in it, and is most likely used in some way with ProtonMail. I originally was going to use Haskell, but decided not to, as it doesn't fit as well.
